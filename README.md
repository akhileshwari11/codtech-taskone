 Project Overview

 Objective
Create a Java program that functions as a basic calculator. The program will prompt the user to enter two numbers and select an operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division). It will then perform the selected operation and display the result to the user.

 Components
1. User Input: Capture two numbers and the desired operation from the user.
2. Operation Selection: Allow the user to choose between addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
3. Perform Calculation: Based on the user's selection, perform the appropriate calculation.
4. Display Result: Output the result of the calculation to the user.

 Steps

1. Setup Development Environment
   - Install Java Development Kit (JDK).
   - Set up an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or use a simple text editor with command-line tools.

2. Create the Main Class
   - Create a Java class (e.g., `BasicCalculator`).

3. Capture User Input
   - Use `Scanner` class to read input from the user.

4. Display Menu and Get Operation Choice
   - Print a menu with the available operations and read the user's choice.

5. Perform the Selected Operation
   - Use a switch-case or if-else statements to determine which operation to perform based on the user's input.

6. Display the Result
   - Print the result of the calculation to the console.

7. Handle Errors
   - Include basic error handling (e.g., division by zero, invalid input).
